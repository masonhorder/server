I have won two district(SRVUSD) wide hackathons, one in 6th grade and one my 8th grade year. I also won first place in a country wide hackathon! I am very experienced in the STEM field. My skills include developing apps, websites, automation tasks; creating physical robots and machines; and I have over 1000 hours of 3d printing!</p>

        <h1>How it works: </h1>
